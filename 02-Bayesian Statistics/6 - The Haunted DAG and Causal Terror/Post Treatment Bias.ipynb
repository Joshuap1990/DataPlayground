    "The language 'post-treatment' comes in fact from thinking about experimental designs. Suppose for example that you are growing some plants in a greenhouse. You want to know the difference in growth under different anti-fungal soil treatments, because fungus on the plants tend to reduce their growth. Plants are intially seeded then sprout. Their heights are measured. Then different soil treatments are applied. Final measures are the height of the plant and the presence of fungus. There are four variables of interest here: initial height, final height, treatment, and presence of fungus. Final height is the outcome of interest. But which of the other variables should be in the model? If your goal is to make a causal inference about the treatment, you shouldn’t include the presence of fungus, because it is a post-treatment effect."

    "Now the impact of treatment is clearly positive, as it should be. It makes sense to control for pre-treatment differences, like the initial height h0, that might mask the causal influence of treatment. But including post-treatment variables can actually mask the treatment itself. This doesn’t mean you don’t want the model that includes both treatment and fungus. The fact that including fungus zeros the coefficient for treatment suggests that the treatment works for exactly the anticipated reasons. It tells us about mechanism. But a correct inference about the treatment still depends upon omitting the post-treatment variable."
